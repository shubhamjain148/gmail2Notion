## ðŸš€ Port emails from gmail to Notion ðŸš€

</div>

Get your emails from gmail which have specific labels into notion and create a reading list out of your newsletters, subscriptions and other things.

Clone this project to get started

## Before using

The project uses [simplegmail](https://github.com/jeremyephron/simplegmail) to connect to your gmail account.

Follow the [getting started](https://github.com/jeremyephron/simplegmail#getting-started) section of that repo to setup connection with gmail.

> **NOTE:** Make sure you create a Desktop Client for Google OAuth so you don't have to add
> a redirect URL

## Setting up Notion and Secret

[Follow these steps](https://developers.notion.com/docs) to get your database id and notion secret integration key

- Along with name column create another column named as `From` which is of select type and prepopulate it with some values which you want to store so that you know from whom the email is like `x`, `y` and `z`
- Add your databaseId in place of `defaultDatabaseId` in `addToNotion.py`
- Add your secret integration key in place of `integrationKey` in `addToNotion.py`

## How to use the script

1. To get started, choose a label from your gmail you want to move to notion,

> **ðŸ’¡Pro Tip:** Create a filter for the emails which you want to move and add specific labels to emails in those filters. So going forward emails which come under the filter will automatically get labelled.

2. Update `labelMappings.json` file to reflect your labels list as keys to that object and the value of the key will be with what name you want to store this into gmail.

```json
{
  "label1": "x",
  "label2": "y"
}
```

So if your `labelMappings.json` file looks like this so the script will read all you emails marked with `label1` and `label2` and store it in notion database by populating From table value as `x` and `y` respective.

> **NOTES:** `x` and `y` are should be some prepopulated values in `From` select column as mentioned in [How to setup Notion section](#Setting-up-Notion-and-Secret)

3.  run the script and your emails are in Notion
